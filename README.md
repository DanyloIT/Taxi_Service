# 🚖Taxi Service App

Hello! My name is Danylo Krupnyk and I am Java Developer! 

This is my Taxi Service project that provides service for drivers to edit infromation about their cars (CRUD is fully invoked)!
The project is made in accordance with the SOLID principles and the so-called three-tier development dividing the entire business application into:
- Presentation layer-business logic (controllers)
- Application layer (services)
- Data access layer (DAO)

Layering is to achieve "high cohesion, low coupling". The idea of "divide and conquer" is adopted to divide the problem into individual solutions, which is easy to control, easy to extend, and easy to allocate resources. 

My application allow registration and login after which user can view all drivers, manufacturers and cars, and also create them by itself.
